This is the [Demo page](https://benwinding.github.io/angular2-wakepark-teaser/) for the angular2 project that I've been working on, source found [here](https://github.com/benwinding/angular2-wakepark-teaser). This page is updated using the angular-cli command:

    ng gh-pages:deploy
    
Which builds the angular app in production mode. Then pushes the compiled result into the github pages branch of this repo.
