# What the hell is this? ...
This is basically a little website for a kite boarding event I'm involved in. It features:
+ Count down to the event in seconds, how exciting!!
+ Location information, using google maps (Coming Soon)
+ 3D preview of kiteboarding obstacles (Coming Soon)
  + Kicker (ramp)
  + Slider (rail)

# What the heck does this use? ...
This site is built on the [angular2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/) framework from google. It also makes use of the following components and libraries:
+ npm (package manager for nodejs librarys)
+ primeng (GUI component helpers)
+ threejs (javascript library to display 3D graphics)
+ angular-cli (command line scripting)
